         Type: DP16KD
Instance Name: user_module1/U1/PLLInst_0
         Type: EHXPLLL

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'u100/u5/GND' of the design has been inferred as
        Global Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is
        'u100/u5/GND'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
