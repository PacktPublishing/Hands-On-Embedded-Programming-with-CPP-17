This is the code repository for [Hands-On Embedded Programming with C++17](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-embedded-programming-c17?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788629300), published by Packt.

**Create versatile and robust embedded solutions for MCUs and RTOSes with modern C++**

## What is this book about?
C++ is a great choice for embedded development, most notably, because it does not add any bloat, extends maintainability, and offers many advantages over different programming languages. Hands-On Embedded Programming with C++17 will show you how C++ can be used to build robust and concurrent systems that leverage the available hardware resources.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Choose the correct type of embedded platform to use for a project 
* Develop drivers for OS-based embedded systems 
* Use concurrency and memory management with various microcontroller units (MCUs) 
* Debug and test cross-platform code with Linux 
* Implement an infotainment system using a Linux-based single board computer 
* Extend an existing embedded system with a Qt-based GUI 
* Communicate with the FPGA side of a hybrid FPGA/SoC system

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
class B : public A { 
   // Private members. 
 
public: 
   // Additional public members. 
}; 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you want to start developing effective embedded programs in C++, then this book is for you. Good knowledge of C++ language constructs is required to understand the topics covered in the book. No knowledge of embedded systems is assumed.
